# SmallTelegramBot
This is small telgram bot that can help you with mailing some information to a large number of group,channel and private messages.
The webhook didn't connect to bot,so work only when local server(your computer) run. 
Initially bot suggested the next use case :
You send on some message from anywhere and bot send this this for all chats or people who is in his base
but also you may simply write him something(but only text, because i didn't set bot to send on such types of message)
Bot wrote with using library TeleBot 
Bot didn't use database, he save all users on file
To run bot, you have to get token from @FatherBot in Telegram
